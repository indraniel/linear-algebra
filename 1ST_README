COMPILING

Why?

Sigh.  OK.  Here is what I just did on a fresh Linux Mint 
box  (2013-Nov-06, Linux Mint 12, equivalent to Ubuntu 12.04).

0) Install the Debian TeX Live (that is, the packages from the archive).
  (I'd rather go with TeX LIve from tug.org but I had to get Sage also and 
  it required me to get the Debian packages and .. I didn't want to end
  in dependency hell.)

1) Clone the linear-algebra mercurial archive.  
  cd ~/Documents
  hg clone https://jim.hefferon@code.google.com/p/linear-algebra/ 

2) Install the luximono font.

  cd ~/Downloads
  wget http://tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/install-getnonfreefonts 
  sudo texlua install-getnonfreefonts
  sudo getnonfreefonts-sys -a
  sudo texhash

  Now comes the sucky part.  I could not get it to find Luximono (running 
  linear-algebra/make_book_for_web.sh says it can't find ul9r8r).
  To the bottom of the file 
    /etc/texmf/updmap.d/00updmap.cfg
  I added the line
    Map ul9.map
  (see http://tug.org/pipermail/texhax/2012-July/019397.html) and ran
    sudo update-updmap
    sudo updmap-sys
  and it now worked.  Dunno.

3) I had to get updated packages from ctan becuase the Debian stuff is old:
    thmtools, geometry, mh
   and install them in /usr/local/share/tex/latex/ .  Then I had to generate 
   the .sty files
     cd  /usr/local/share/tex/latex/thmtools
     sudo pdflatex thmtools.ins
     cd  /usr/local/share/tex/latex/geometry
     sudo pdflatex geometry.ins
   and, just for a change of pace,
     cd  /usr/local/share/tex/latex/mh
     sudo tex mhsetup
     sudo tex breqn.dtx
     sudo tex empheq
     sudo tex flexisym
     sudo tex mathstyle
     sudo tex mathtools

4) Now I can run the shell script that generates the book.  
    cd ~/Documents/linear-algebra
    ./make_book_for_web.sh
(if it fails with something about ul9r8r then see the note in instruction 2). 

At the end, you'll have book.pdf and jhanswer.pdf.  Put them
in the same directory.  You could have skipped the compiling, you know.

If you want projector slides, cd slides and run make_slides.sh.  This takes 
some time, maybe twenty minutes.
