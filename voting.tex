Imagine that a  Political Science class studying the 
American presidential process holds a mock election.
The $29$ class members
rank the Democratic Party,
Republican Party, and Third Party nominees,
from most preferred to least preferred
($>$ means `is preferred to').

What is the preference of the group as a whole?

Overall,
the group prefers the Democrat to the Republican by five votes; 
seventeen voters ranked the Democrat above the Republican
versus twelve the other way.
And the group 
prefers the Republican to the Third's nominee, 
fifteen to fourteen.
But, strangely enough, the group also 
prefers the Third to the Democrat, eighteen to eleven.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{voting.1}
\end{center}
This is a \definend{voting paradox}\index{voting paradox},
specifically, a
\definend{majority cycle}.\index{voting paradox!majority cycle}

Mathematicians study voting paradoxes in part because of their 
implications for practical politics.
For instance, the instructor of this class can manipulate them
into choosing the Democrat as the overall winner 
by first asking for a vote to choose between the Republican and
the Third, 
and then asking for a vote to choose between the winner of that contest, the
Republican, and the Democrat.   
The instructor can make any of the other two candidates come out as the winner
by similar manipulations. 
(Here we will stick to three-candidate elections but the same thing
happens in larger elections.)

Mathematicians also study voting paradoxes simply because they are
interesting.
One interesting aspect is that
the group's overall majority cycle occurs despite that  
each single voter's preference list is 
\definend{rational}\index{voting paradox!rational preference order}, in 
a straight-line order.
That is, the majority cycle seems to arise in the aggregate
without being present in the components of that aggregate, the preference lists.
However we can use linear algebra  to argue that
a tendency toward cyclic preference is actually present
in each voter's list and
that it surfaces when there is more adding of the tendency
than canceling.

For this,
abbreviating the choices as $D$, $R$, and $T$,
we can describe how
a voter with preference order $D>R>T$ contributes to the above cycle.
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics{voting.2}
\end{center}
(The negative sign is here because the arrow describes $T$ as 
preferred to $D$, but this voter likes them the other way.)
The descriptions for the other preference lists are in the table on 
page~\pageref{table:Voting}.

Now, to conduct the election we linearly combine these descriptions; 
for instance, the Political Science mock election
\begin{equation*}
  5\cdot \votinggraphic{43}
  +4\cdot\votinggraphic{44}
  +\dots+2\cdot\votinggraphic{45}
\tag*{}\end{equation*}
yields the circular group preference shown earlier.

Of course, taking linear combinations is linear algebra.
The graphical cycle notation is suggestive but inconvenient so we 
use column vectors by starting at the $D$ and
taking the numbers from the cycle in counterclockwise order.   
Thus, we represent the mock election and a single $D>R>T$ vote in this way. 
\begin{equation*}
  \votepreflist{7}{1}{5}
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  \votepreflist{-1}{1}{1}
\tag*{}\end{equation*}

We will 
decompose vote vectors into two parts, one
cyclic and the other acyclic.
For the first part, 
we say that a vector is \definend{purely cyclic} if it is in  
this subspace of $\Re^3$. 
\begin{equation*}
  C
  =\set{\votepreflist{k}{k}{k} \suchthat k \in\Re}
  =\set{k\cdot\votepreflist{1}{1}{1} \suchthat k \in\Re}
\end{equation*}
For the second part, consider the set 
of vectors that are 
perpendicular to all of the vectors in $C$.
\nearbyexercise{exer:PerpIsSubSp} shows that this is a subspace. 
\begin{multline*}
  C^\perp =\set{\votepreflist{c_1}{c_2}{c_3} \suchthat 
                 \colvec{c_1 \\ c_2 \\ c_3}\dotprod\colvec{k \\ k \\ k} =0
                 \text{\ for all $k\in\Re$}}             \\
          =\set{\votepreflist{c_1}{c_2}{c_3} \suchthat 
                 c_1+c_2+c_3=0}                                         
          =\set{c_2\votepreflist{-1}{1}{0}
                +c_3\votepreflist{-1}{0}{1} \suchthat  c_2,c_3\in\Re}
\end{multline*}
(Read the name as ``$C$~perp.'')
So we are led to this basis for $\Re^3$.
\begin{equation*}
 \sequence{\votepreflist{1}{1}{1},
             \votepreflist{-1}{1}{0},
             \votepreflist{-1}{0}{1}}
\tag*{}\end{equation*}
We can represent votes with respect to this basis,
and thereby decompose them into a cyclic part and an acyclic part.
\textit{(Note for readers who have covered the optional section
in this chapter:~that is, the space is the direct sum of $C$ and~$C^\perp$.)}

For example, consider the $D>R>T$ voter discussed above.
We represent it with respect to the basis
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \begin{linsys}{3}
    c_1  &-  &c_2  &-  &c_3  &=  &-1 \\
    c_1  &+  &c_2  &   &     &=  &1  \\
    c_1  &   &     &+  &c_3  &=  &1  
  \end{linsys}
  &\grstep[-\rho_1+\rho_3]{-\rho_1+\rho_2}\;
  \grstep{(-1/2)\rho_2+\rho_3}
  &\begin{linsys}{3}
    c_1  &-  &c_2  &-  &c_3      &=  &-1 \\
         &   &2c_2 &+  &c_3      &=  &2  \\
         &   &     &   &(3/2)c_3 &=  &1  
  \end{linsys}
\end{eqnarray*}
using the coordinates $c_1=1/3$, $c_2=2/3$, and $c_3=2/3$.
Then
\begin{equation*}
  \votepreflist{-1}{1}{1}
  =\frac{1}{3}\cdot\votepreflist{1}{1}{1}
    +\frac{2}{3}\cdot\votepreflist{-1}{1}{0}
    +\frac{2}{3}\cdot\votepreflist{-1}{0}{1}
  =\votepreflist{1/3}{1/3}{1/3}
   +\votepreflist{-4/3}{2/3}{2/3}
\tag*{}\end{equation*}
gives the desired decomposition into a 
cyclic part and an acyclic part.
\begin{equation*}
  \votinggraphic{3}
=
\votinggraphic{4}
+
\votinggraphic{5}
\end{equation*}
Thus we can see that this $D>R>T$ voter's
rational preference list does have a cyclic part.

The $T>R>D$ voter is opposite to the one just considered
in that the `$>$' symbols are reversed. 
This voter's decomposition 
\begin{equation*}
\votinggraphic{6}
=
\votinggraphic{7}
+
\votinggraphic{8}
\end{equation*}
shows that these opposite preferences have decompositions that are opposite.
We say that the first voter has positive 
\definend{spin}\index{spin}\index{voting paradoxes!spin}
since the cycle part is with the direction 
that we have chosen for the arrows, 
while the second voter's spin is negative.

The fact that these opposite voters cancel each other is reflected in 
the fact that their vote vectors add to zero.
This suggests an alternate way to tally an election. 
We could first cancel as many opposite preference lists as possible,
and then determine the outcome by adding the remaining lists. 

The rows of the table below contain the three pairs of 
opposite preference lists.
The columns group those pairs by spin.
For instance, the first row contains the two voters just considered.

If we conduct the election as just described then after the cancellation
of as many opposite pairs of voters as possible then there will be left three
sets of preference lists:~one set from the first row, one from the second
row, and one from the third row. 
We will finish by proving that
a voting paradox can happen only if
the spins of these three sets are in the same direction.
That is, for a voting paradox to occur, the three remaining sets must all come
from the left of the table or all come from the right
(see \nearbyexercise{exer:CancelPolSci}).
This shows that there is some connection between the majority cycle and
the decomposition that we are using\Dash a 
voting paradox can happen only when the
tendencies toward cyclic preference reinforce each other.

For the proof, assume that we have cancelled 
opposite preference orders and we are left with one set
of preference lists from each of the three rows.
Consider the sum of these three
(here, the numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ could be positive, negative, or zero).
\begin{equation*}
  \votinggraphic{27}  %\votecycle{a}{a}{-a}{4} 
  +  
  \votinggraphic{28}  %\votecycle{-b}{b}{b}{4} 
  +  
  \votinggraphic{29}  %\votecycle{c}{-c}{c}{4}  
  =\hspace{.30in}
  \votinggraphic{30}  %\votecycle{a-b+c}{a+b-c}{-a+b+c}{4}
  \hspace{.30in}\hbox{}  
\end{equation*}
A voting paradox occurs when the three numbers on the right,
$a-b+c$ and $a+b-c$ and $-a+b+c$, are all nonnegative or all nonpositive.
On the left, at least two of the three numbers $a$ and $b$ and $c$ 
are both nonnegative or both nonpositive.
We can assume that they are $a$ and $b$.
That makes four cases:~the cycle is nonnegative and
$a$ and $b$ are nonnegative, the cycle is
nonpositive and $a$ and $b$ are nonpositive, etc.
We will do only the first case, since the second is similar
and the other two are also easy.

So assume that the cycle is nonnegative and
that $a$ and $b$ are nonnegative.
The conditions $0\leq a-b+c$ and $0\leq -a+b+c$ add to give
that $0\leq 2c$, which implies that $c$ is also nonnegative, as desired.
That ends the proof.

This result says only that having all three spin in the same direction is a 
necessary condition for a majority cycle.
It is not sufficient; see
\nearbyexercise{exer:VoterCondNotSuff}.

Voting theory and associated topics are the subject of current research.
There are many intriguing results, most notably 
the one produced by K~Arrow \cite{Arrow}, who won the Nobel Prize in part for
this work, showing that no voting system is entirely fair
(for a reasonable definition of ``fair'').
For more information, some good introductory articles are \cite{Gardner70}, 
\cite{Gardner74}, \cite{Gardner80}, and \cite{NeimiRiker}.
\cite{Taylor} is a readable recent book.
The long list of cases from recent American political history in 
\cite{GamingVote} shows these paradoxes are 
routinely manipulated in practice.
 
This Topic is largely drawn from \cite{Zwicker}.
\emph{(Author's Note:~I would like to thank Professor~Zwicker 
for his kind and illuminating discussions.)}

\begin{exercises}
  \item \label{IrrIndVote}
    Here is a reasonable way in which a voter could have a cyclic preference.
    Suppose that this voter ranks each candidate
    on each of three criteria.
    \begin{exparts}
      \partsitem Draw up a table with the rows labeled `Democrat',
         `Republican', and `Third', and the columns labeled
         `character', `experience', and `policies'.
         Inside each column, rank some 
         candidate as most preferred, 
         rank another as in the middle, and rank the remaining one
         as least preferred.
      \partsitem In this ranking, is the Democrat preferred to the Republican
         in (at least) two out of three criteria, or vice versa?
         Is the Republican preferred to the Third?
      \partsitem  Does the table that was 
         just constructed have a cyclic preference order?
         If not, make one that does.
    \end{exparts}
    So it is possible for a voter to have a cyclic preference among candidates.
    The paradox described above, however, is that even if each voter has a
    straight-line preference list, 
    a cyclic preference can still arise for the entire group. 
    \begin{answer}
      This is one example that yields a non-rational preference order for a 
      single voter.
      \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|}
             \multicolumn{1}{c}{\ }
                  &\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textit{character}}
                  &\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textit{experience}}
                  &\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textit{policies}}   \\ 
          \cline{2-4}
         \textit{Democrat}   &most    &middle  &least   \\
         \textit{Republican} &middle  &least   &most    \\
         \textit{Third}      &least   &most    &middle  \\
          \cline{2-4}
        \end{tabular}
      \end{center}
      The Democrat is preferred to the Republican for character and
      experience.
      The Republican is preferred to the Third for character and policies.
      And, the Third is preferred to the Democrat for experience and policies.
    \end{answer}
  \item \label{VoteCalcTable} 
    Compute the values in the table of decompositions.
    \begin{answer}
      First, compare the $D>R>T$ decomposition that was covered in the Topic
      with the decomposition of the opposite $T>R>D$ voter.
      \begin{equation*}
        \votepreflist{-1}{1}{1}
          =\frac{1}{3}\cdot\votepreflist{1}{1}{1}
           +\frac{2}{3}\cdot\votepreflist{-1}{1}{0}
           +\frac{2}{3}\cdot\votepreflist{-1}{0}{1}
        \quad\text{and}\quad
        \votepreflist{1}{-1}{-1}
          =d_1\cdot\votepreflist{1}{1}{1}
           +d_2\cdot\votepreflist{-1}{1}{0}
           +d_3\cdot\votepreflist{-1}{0}{1}
      \tag*{}\end{equation*}
      Obviously, the second is the negative of the first, and so
      $d_1=-1/3$, $d_2=-2/3$, and $d_3=-2/3$.
      This principle holds for any pair of opposite voters, and so we need only
      do the computation for a voter from the second row, and a voter from the 
      third row.
      For a positive spin voter in the second row,
      \begin{equation*}
        \begin{linsys}{3}
          c_1  &-  &c_2  &-  &c_3  &=  &1 \\
          c_1  &+  &c_2  &   &     &=  &1  \\
          c_1  &   &     &+  &c_3  &=  &-1  
        \end{linsys}
        \;\grstep[-\rho_1+\rho_3]{-\rho_1+\rho_2}\;
        \grstep{(-1/2)\rho_2+\rho_3}
        \;\begin{linsys}{3}
          c_1  &-  &c_2  &-  &c_3      &=  &1 \\
               &   &2c_2 &+  &c_3      &=  &0  \\
               &   &     &   &(3/2)c_3 &=  &-2  
        \end{linsys}
      \tag*{}\end{equation*}
      gives $c_3=-4/3$, $c_2=2/3$, and $c_1=1/3$.
      For a positive spin voter in the third row,
      \begin{equation*}
        \begin{linsys}{3}
          c_1  &-  &c_2  &-  &c_3  &=  &1 \\
          c_1  &+  &c_2  &   &     &=  &-1  \\
          c_1  &   &     &+  &c_3  &=  &1  
        \end{linsys}

  \item \label{exer:CancelPolSci} 
    Do the cancellations of opposite preference orders 
    for the Political Science class's mock election.
    Are all the remaining preferences from the left three rows of the
    table or from the right?
    \begin{answer}
      The mock election corresponds to the table on 
      page~\pageref{table:Voting} in the way shown in the first table,
      and after cancellation the result is the second table.

  \item \label{exer:VoterCondNotSuff} 
    The necessary condition that is proved above\Dash a
    voting paradox can happen only if all three preference lists remaining
    after cancellation have the same spin---is not also sufficient. 
    \begin{exparts}
      \partsitem Continuing the positive cycle case considered in the proof, 
        use the two inequalities $0\leq a-b+c$ and $0\leq -a+b+c$
        to show that $\absval{a-b}\leq c$.
      \partsitem Also show that $c\leq a+b$, and hence that
        $\absval{a-b}\leq c\leq a+b$. 
      \partsitem Give an example of a vote where there is a majority cycle,
        and addition of one more voter with the same spin causes the cycle to
        go away.
      \partsitem Can the opposite happen; can addition of one voter with 
        a ``wrong'' spin cause a cycle to appear?
      \partsitem Give a condition that is both necessary and sufficient
        to get a majority cycle.
    \end{exparts}
    \begin{answer}
      \begin{exparts}
        \partsitem The two can be rewritten as $-c\leq a-b$ and $-c\leq b-a$.
          Either $a-b$ or $b-a$ is nonpositive and so $-c\leq-\absval{a-b}$,
          as required.
        \partsitem This is immediate from the supposition that $0\leq a+b-c$.
        \partsitem A trivial example starts with the zero-voter election and
          adds any one voter.
          A more interesting example is to take the Political Science mock
          election and add two $T>D>R$ voters
          (they can be added one at a time, to satisfy the
          ``addition of one more voter'' criteria in the question).
          Observe that the additional voters have positive spin, which is the
          spin of the votes remaining after cancellation in the original mock
          election.
          This is the resulting table of voters, and next to it is 
          the result of cancellation.

        \partsitem A two-voter election can have a majority cycle in two ways.
          First, the two voters could be opposites,
          resulting after cancellation in the trivial election (with the 
          majority cycle of all zeroes).
          Second, the two voters could have the same spin but come from
          different rows, as here.

        \partsitem There are two cases.
          An even number of voters can split half and half into opposites,
          e.g., half the voters are $D>R>T$ and half are $T>R>D$.
          Then cancellation gives the trivial election.
          If the number of voters is greater than one and odd (of the
          form $2k+1$ with $k>0$) then using the cycle diagram from the proof,
          \begin{equation*}
            \votinggraphic{27}  %\votecycle{a}{a}{-a}{4} 
            +  
            \votinggraphic{28}  %\votecycle{-b}{b}{b}{4} 
            +  
            \votinggraphic{29}  %\votecycle{c}{-c}{c}{4}  
            =\hspace{.30in}
            \votinggraphic{30}  %\votecycle{a-b+c}{a+b-c}{-a+b+c}{4}
            \hspace{.30in}\hbox{}  
          \end{equation*}
%          \begin{center}
%            \votecycle{a}{a}{-a}{4} 
%            +  
%            \votecycle{-b}{b}{b}{4} 
%            +  
%            \votecycle{c}{-c}{c}{4}  
%            =\hspace{.30in}  
%            \votecycle{a-b+c}{a+b-c}{-a+b+c}{4}\hspace{.30in}\hbox{}  
%          \end{center}
          we can take $a=k$ and $b=k$ and $c=1$.
          Because $k>0$, this is a majority cycle.

\item \label{exer:PerpIsSubSp} 
    Let $U$ be a subspace of $\Re^3$.
    Prove that the set 
    $U^\perp=\set{\vec{v}\suchthat 
              \text{$\vec{v}\dotprod\vec{u}=0$ for all $\vec{u}\in U$}}$
    of vectors 
    that are perpendicular to each vector in $U$ is also subspace of $\Re^3$.
    Does this hold if $U$ is not a subspace?
    \begin{answer}
      It is nonempty because it contains the zero vector.
      To see that it is closed under linear combinations of two of its
      members, suppose that $\vec{v}_1$ and $\vec{v}_2$ are in $U^\perp$
      and consider $c_1\vec{v}_1+c_2\vec{v}_2$.
      For any $\vec{u}\in U$,
      \begin{equation*}
        (c_1\vec{v}_1+c_2\vec{v}_2)\dotprod\vec{u}
        =c_1(\vec{v}_1\dotprod\vec{u})+c_2(\vec{v}_2\dotprod\vec{u})
        =c_1\cdot 0+c_2\cdot 0=0         
      \tag*{}\end{equation*}
      and so $c_1\vec{v}_1+c_2\vec{v}_2\in U^\perp$.

      This holds if $U$ is any subset, subspace or not.
