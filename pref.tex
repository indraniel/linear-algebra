\chapter*{Preface}
This book helps students to master the material of a standard 
US undergraduate first course in Linear Algebra.

The material is standard in that the subjects covered are
Gaussian reduction, 
vector spaces, linear maps,
determinants, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Another standard is book's audience:
sophomores or juniors, usually with a background 
of at least one semester of calculus. 
The help that it gives to students comes from taking a developmental 
approach\Dash 
this book's presentation emphasizes motivation and naturalness, 
using many examples as well as extensive and careful exercises.

The developmental approach is what most recommends this book
so I will elaborate.
Courses at the beginning of a mathematics program
focus less on theory and more on calculating.
Later courses
ask for mathematical maturity:~the ability to follow different 
types of arguments, 
a familiarity with
the themes that underlie many mathematical investigations such as
elementary set and function facts,
and a capacity for some independent reading and thinking.
Some programs have a separate course devoted to developing maturity but
in any case a Linear Algebra course 
is an ideal spot to work on this transition to more rigor.
It comes early in a program so that progress made here pays off later
but also comes late enough so that the 
students in the class are serious about mathematics.
The material is accessible, coherent, and elegant.
There are a variety of argument styles, including 
proofs by
contradiction and proofs by induction.
And, examples are plentiful.

Helping readers start the transition to being serious students of 
mathematics
requires taking the mathematics seriously so
all of the results here are proved.
On the other hand, we cannot
assume that students have already arrived
and so 
in contrast with more advanced texts 
this book is filled with examples,
often quite detailed.

Some texts that assume a not-yet sophisticated reader
begin with extensive computations, including 
matrix multiplication
and determinants.
Then, when 
vector spaces and linear maps finally appear
and definitions and proofs start, the abrupt change
brings students to an abrupt stop.
While this book begins with
linear reduction, from the start
we do more than compute.
The first chapter
includes proofs, such as that linear reduction gives a correct and
complete solution set.
With that as motivation
the second chapter begins with real vector spaces.
In the schedule below this happens at the start of the third week.

% Another example of the emphasis here on motivation and naturalness
% is that the chapter on linear maps
% does not begin with the definition of homomorphism.
% Instead it begins with the definition of isomorphism, which
% is natural\Dash students themselves
% observe that some spaces are ``the same'' as others.
% After that,
% the next section takes the reasonable step of 
% isolating the operation-preservation idea
% to define homomorphism.
% This loses some mathematical slickness 
% but it is a good trade because it gives to students
% a large gain in sensibility.

A student progresses most in mathematics while doing exercises. 
The problem sets start with 
routine checks and range up to reasonably involved proofs.
% Since instructors often assign about a dozen exercises
I have aimed to typically put two dozen in each set, 
thereby giving a selection.
There are even a few that are puzzles
taken from various journals, competitions, or
problems collections. 
These are marked with a
`\puzzlemark' and 
as part of the fun I have kept the original wording
as much as possible.

That is, as with the rest of the book, 
the exercises are aimed to both build an ability at,
and help students experience the pleasure of, 
\emph{doing} mathematics.
Students should see how the ideas arise and should be able to 
picture themselves doing the same type of work.

\medskip
\noindent{\bf Applications.}
%\smallskip
% The point of view taken here, that students should think of 
% Linear Algebra as about vector spaces
% and linear maps, is not taken to the complete exclusion of others.
Applications and computing are interesting and vital aspects 
of the subject.
Consequently, each chapter closes with a selection of
topics in those areas.
These give a reader
a taste of the subject, discuss how Linear Algebra comes in,
point to some further reading, and give a few exercises. 
They are brief enough that an instructor can do one
in a day's class 
or can assign them as projects for individuals or small groups.
Whether they figure formally in a course or not, they help
readers see for themselves that Linear Algebra is a tool
that a professional must have. 




\medskip
\noindent{\bf Availability.}
This book is Free.
In particular, instructors can run off copies for students 
and sell them at the bookstore.
See this book's web page 
\url{http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra}
for the license details.
That page also has the latest version, 
exercise answers, beamer slides, lab manual, additional material,
and \LaTeX\ source.



\medskip
\noindent{\bf Acknowledgments.}
A lesson of software
development is that complex projects need a process for bug fixes.
I am grateful for such reports from both instructors and students
and I periodically issue revisions. 
My contact information is on the web page.

I thank Gabriel S Santiago for the cover colors.
I am also grateful to Saint Michael's College 
for supporting this project over many years.

And, I thank my wife Lynne for her unflagging encouragement.

\noindent{\bf Advice.}
%\smallskip
%
This book's emphasis on motivation and development,
and its availability, make it widely used for self-study.
If you are an independent student then good for you, I admire your industry.
However, you may find some advice useful.

While an experienced instructor knows what subjects and
pace suit their class, this semester's timetable 
(graciously shared by George Ashline)
may help you plan a sensible rate.
It
presumes Section~One.II, the elements of vectors.

(Using this schedule as a target, I find that I have room for a lecture
or two on an application or from the lab manual.)
Note that 
in addition to the in-class exams,
students in this course do 
take-home problems that include arguments, for instance showing that
a set is a vector space.
Computations are important but so are the proofs.

In the table of contents
I have marked subsections as optional if
some instructors will pass over them in favor of spending more time elsewhere. 

As enrichment, you might pick one or two topics that appeal to you 
from the end of each chapter or from the lab manual.
You'll get more from these
if you have access to software for calculations.
I recommend \textit{Sage}, freely available 
from \url{http://sagemath.org}.

My main advice is: do many exercises.
I have marked a good sample with \recommendationmark's in the margin.
Do not simply read the answers\Dash you must
try the problems and possibly struggle with them.
For all of the exercises, you must justify your answer either with a computation
or with a proof.
Be aware that few people can write correct proofs without training;
try to find a knowledgeable person to work with you.

Finally, a caution for all students, independent or not:~I 
cannot overemphasize that the 
statement, ``I understand the material but it is only 
that I have trouble with the problems''\spacefactor=1000\ %
shows a misconception.
Being able to do things with the ideas is their entire point.
The quotes below express this sentiment admirably
(I have taken the liberty of formatting them as poetry).
They capture the essence of both the beauty and the power
of mathematics and science in general, 
and of Linear Algebra in particular.

\par\noindent\textit{Author's Note.}
Inventing a good exercise, one that enlightens as well as tests, 
is a creative act, and hard work.
The inventor deserves recognition.
But texts have traditionally not given attributions for
questions.
I have changed that here where I was sure of the source.
I would be glad to hear from anyone who can help me to correctly
attribute others of the questions.
